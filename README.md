# DropZoneRepro

This is the minimal repro for the issue logged as [Reordering Items in DropContainer Takes ~1-minute to Complete](https://support.blazorise.com/issues/80/Reordering-Items-in-DropContainer-Takes-1-minute-to-Complete) in Blazorize Commercial Support

This creates the same nested models as in the original solution where I ran into the issue...the model names are purely arbitrary.

All the repro code is in `DropZoneRepro/DropZoneRepro/Pages/Repro.razor`
